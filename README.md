## Core Concept: Customizable System Prompts

A standout feature of GemAI is its support for customizable system prompts using local Markdown (`.md`) files. For each command, you can specify a corresponding Markdown file (e.g., `Translator.md`, `Summarize.md`) in a directory of your choice (configurable in preferences).

**How it works:**

1.  In GemAI's preferences, set your "Prompt Directory" (e.g., `~/Documents/MyGemAIPrompts`).
2.  For any command you wish to customize, create a Markdown file in that directory with the name specified in the command's preferences (e.g., `Translator.md`).
3.  Write your desired system prompt within this Markdown file. GemAI will use this prompt to instruct the AI for that specific command.
    *   If a custom prompt file is not found or not specified, GemAI will use a built-in fallback prompt.

**Benefits:**

*   **Easy Editing:** Use your favorite Markdown editor (like Obsidian, VS Code, etc.) to write and refine prompts.
*   **Version Control:** Store your prompt directory in a Git repository to track changes, revert to previous versions, and share configurations.
*   **Personalization:** Tailor the AI's tone, style, and response format to perfectly match your requirements for each task.
*   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Experiment with complex prompt structures and instructions.

## Tech Stack

*   TypeScript
*   Raycast API
*   Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   Node.js (for file system operations and utility scripts)

## Prerequisites

*   **Raycast:** GemAI is an extension for Raycast.
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** You need a valid API key from Google AI Studio. You can obtain one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Raycast installed on your macOS.
2.  Install GemAI from the Raycast Store.
3.  After installation, configure the extension preferences.

## Configuration

Access GemAI's preferences within Raycast to set up the following:

*   **Gemini API Key (Required):** Your Google Gemini API key.
*   **Default Model (Required):** Choose the default Gemini model to be used across commands (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`).
*   **Custom Model (Optional):** Specify a custom model name if you're using one not in the default list. This overrides the default model.
*   **Primary Language (Required):** The default language for AI responses and one of the languages for the Translator command (e.g., "English").
*   **Prompt Directory (Optional):** The full path to the directory where you store your custom Markdown system prompt files (e.g., `~/Documents/Prompts/Raycast`).

Each command also has preferences to:
*   **Override the Model:** Select a specific Gemini model just for that command.
*   **Set Secondary Language (for Translator & Grammar):** Specify the other language for translation or proofreading.
*   **Specify Prompt File:** The name of the Markdown file (within your Prompt Directory) to use as the system prompt for that command (e.g., `Translator.md`).

## Basic Usage

1.  **Invoke a Command:** Open Raycast and type the name of the GemAI command you want to use (e.g., "Summarize it", "Translate").
2.  **Input Text:**
    *   Most commands will automatically use any text you have currently selected on your screen.
    *   If no text is selected, or for commands like "Ask GemAI any question", you can type your query or text directly into the Raycast input field.
    *   Some commands like "Ask GemAI any question" also support attaching files (images, text files) via the form that appears if no initial text is provided.
3.  **Screenshot Commands:**
    *   Commands like "Screenshot -> Markdown" or "Screenshot -> Explain" will first prompt you to select an area of your screen.
    *   After capturing, the image will be processed, and you might be prompted for additional instructions (e.g., for "Screenshot -> Explain").

Remember to configure your API key and other preferences for the extension to function correctly. Explore the custom prompt feature to truly unlock GemAI's potential!
